# FAQ

### Why does the application crash or stop working after some time?

The demo apps are provided in trial mode – i.e without a license key – so the SDK runs only for a minute.

To test the document scanner without this time limit, request a free, 30-day Evaluation License for your own application identifier on [our website](https://geniusscansdk.com).

### How can I get a Genius Scan SDK license for my application?

You can purchase a production license of the Genius Scan SDK for your application by submitting a _Quote request_ on [our website](https://geniusscansdk.com).
